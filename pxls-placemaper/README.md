# pxls-placemaper
Placemap for pxls.space.

Input file items can be found on:

For all resources [Pxls Items](https://pxls.space/extra).

The main folder should look like

![this](https://github.com/Chssam/pixel_maper/blob/main/sources/pxls-placemaper%20outlook.png)

Change any value in **settings.ron** file

Warn:
- Pixel self replaced not accurate (Maybe)
- Don't hope everything accurate I guess

Cover
- V0.1.1 - Use txt as palette
- V0.2.0 - Use json as palette (Which include name)
- V0.2.0 - slower 20s than V0.1.1
- V0.3.0 - All items from [Pxls Items](https://pxls.space/extra)
- V0.3.0 - Same process time as V0.1.1
- V0.Latest - Image Name Lookup Changes
- V0.Latest - Abandoned the name, follow up with the latest number instead
- V0.4 - With GIF Placemap!

Suggest to use the latest, got more features and ~~bug~~ fixes.

Additional:
- Only tested or after C71
- Somehow C74 logs String Broken
- V0.1, 2, 3 tested in debug mode, so it might look like it took longer than V0.4 (Tested in Release Mode) to complete.
