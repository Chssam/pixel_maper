2. **input** items can be found on [Pxls Items](https://pxls.space/extra)
3. Change any value in **settings.ron** file
4. Execute pxls-placemaper
5. Items will be generated in 'output' folder
6. Your STATS!

Warn:
- Not accurate, maybe
- There's tiny difference between Clueless's placemap vs this one

Cover
- V0.1.1 - Use txt as palette
- V0.2.0 - Use json as palette (Which include name)
- V0.2.0 - slower 20s than V0.1.1
- V0.3.0 - All items from [Pxls Items](https://pxls.space/extra)
- V0.3.0 - Same process time as V0.1.1
- V0.Latest - Image Name Lookup Changes
- V0.Latest - Abandoned the name, follow up with the latest number instead
- V0.4 - With GIF Placemap!
- V0.5 - "canvas_code" in setting.ron file now accept String
- V0.5.1 - Some changes forgotten, now with executable application

Suggest to use the latest, got more features and ~~bug~~ fixes.

Additional:
- Only tested after C71
- Somehow can't read C74 logs 
- V0.1, 2, 3 tested in debug mode, while V0.4 tested in release mode, basically V0.4 slower because more feature.
